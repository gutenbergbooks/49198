mouth of a critic&mdash;with a black border.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You do beat all nater, Hanks, with the fiddle; your hand
is as cute, and your ear as fine, as though the one had never held
a plough, or the other listened to the jingling of a cowbell. Talk
of your genuses. Give me the chap that's a Jack at any thing, from
digging ninety tater-hills afore breakfast, to sparking a pretty girl
at 'leven o'clock on a starlight night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> What are you laughing at? If old Corum mistook me for a
prowler one night, am I to blame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> Coorse not, coorse not, when you didn't stop to
'lucidate, but jumped de fence and scooted down de road hollering
"Murder!" (<i>Laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>flinging an ear of corn at</i> <span class="smcap">Stub</span>). A little
more ear and less tongue, Stub.</p>

out, Nat, if you do make up to my property, Kitty Corum. (<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <span class="smcap">r.</span>, <i>overhearing last words</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Indeed! Your property! I like that. And when, pray,
did you come into possession?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> That's for you to say, Kitty. I'm an expectant heir as
yet. Don't forget me in your will, Kitty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Give me the title, Kitty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I'd give you a title&mdash;Counter-jumper, Yardstick; that's
about your measure. You talk about titles; why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> all you are good for
is to measure tape and ribbons, cut "nigger-head," shovel sugar, and
peddle herrings for old Gleason. Bah! I smell soap now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>jumping up</i>). You just step outside, and you shall
smell brimstone, and find your measure on the turf, Tom Larcom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> There, there, stop that! I'll have no quarrelling.
Supper's nearly ready, and the corn not finished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> We'll be ready for the supper, Kitty. If I could only
find a red ear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> And if you could?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I should make an impression on those red lips of yours
that would astonish you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Indeed! It would astonish me more if you had the
chance. (<i>Laugh.</i>) But where's Harry Maynard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Off gunning with Mr. Thornton. He said he'd be back in
time for the husking: they must have lost their way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> His last night at home, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> Yas, indeed. Off in de mornin', afore de broke ob day.
I's gwine to drive dem ober to de steam-jine station. Miss Jennie
gwine to see him off; 'spect she'll jes cry her eyes out comin' home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, I can't see the use of Harry Maynard's trottin'
off to the city with this Mr. Thornton. Let well enough alone, say I.
Here's a good farm, and a smart, pretty girl ready to share life with
him; and yet off he goes to take risks in something he knows nothing
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Don't say a word against Mr. Thornton; he's just
splendid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus of Girls.</span> Oh, elegant!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> There it is! Vanity and vexation! here's a man old
enough to be your father. Comes up here in his fine clothes, with a
big watch-chain across his chest, and a seal ring on his finger, and
you girls are dead in love with him at first sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Tom, you're jealous. Harry Maynard is not content to
settle down here; he wants to see the world, and I like his spunk. If
I was a man <i>I</i> would get the polish of city life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> So would I, so would I. Yas, indeed; get de polish down
dar. Look at Joe Trash; he went down dar, he did. New suit ob store
clo's onto him, and forty dollars in his calf-skin. He come back in
free days polished right out ob his boots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, I s'pose it's out of fashion not to like this
Thornton, but there's something in the twist of his waxed-end
mustache, and the roll of his eye, that makes me feel bad for Harry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> You needn't fear for Harry. He won't eat him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> No, sir, he's not a connubial: he's a gemblum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ah! here's the last ear, and, by jingo! it's a red one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Good for you, Tom! good for you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> I'll give you a dollar for your chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> No, you don't, Nat; I'm in luck.&mdash;Now, Kitty, I claim
the privilege. A kiss for the finder of the red ear. (<i>All rise.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Don't scold, Tom. It's the first game that has crossed
my path to-day: the first shot I've made. So the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> corn is husked,

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> (<span class="smcap">r. c.</span> <span class="smcap">Thornton</span> <i>sits on stool</i>,

sharp lookout, for there's a keen hunter on the track, and when Tom
Larcom flings the matrimonial noose&mdash;</p>

empty-handed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Fiddlesticks! (<i>pushes him back, and comes to</i> <span class="smcap">l.
C.</span>) If there is any thing I hate, it's sparking before company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<span class="smcap">l.</span>). And there's where you're right, Kitty.
As much as I love you, I would never dare to be so outspoken before
company.</p>

says she, you're to come right into de kitchen, eat all you like,
drink all you like, an' smash all de dishes if you like; an' dere's
fourteen kinds ob pies, an' turnobers, an' turn-unders, an' cold
chicken, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;cheese&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> That will do, Stub. My good mother is a bountiful
provider, and needs no herald. So, neighbors, take your partners;
Hanks will give you a march, and Mr. Thornton and I will join you as
soon as we have removed the marks of the forlorn chase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<span class="smcap">c.</span>). Cut,&mdash;a decided cut. I must lay in wait
for Yardstick when this breaks up, and I think he will need about a

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> (<i>goes to bench</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>, <i>and washes hands</i>). Now,
Mr. Thornton, for a wash, and then we'll join them. (<span class="smcap">Thornton</span>
<i>keeps his seat in a thoughtful attitude</i>. <span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>comes
down</i>.) Hallo! what's the matter? Homesick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>laughs</i>). Not exactly; but there's something in
this old barn, these merry huskers, this careless happy life you
farmers lead, has stirred up old memories, until I was on the point of
breaking out with that melancholy song, "Oh, would I were a boy again!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Now, don't be melancholy. That won't chime with the
dear old place; for, though it has not been free from trouble, we
drive all care away with willing hands and cheerful hearts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> It is a cheery old place, and so reminds me of one
I knew when I was young; for, like you, I was a farmer's boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Indeed! you never told me that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> No: for 'tis no fond recollection to me, and I
seldom refer to it. I did not take kindly to it, so early forsook a
country life for the stir and bustle of crowded cities. But, when one
has reached the age of forty, 'tis time to look back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Not with regret, I trust: for you tell me you have
acquired wealth in mercantile pursuits, and so pictured the busy life
of the city, that I am impatient to carve my fortune there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> And you are right. The strong-armed, clear-brained
wanderers from the country carry off the grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> prizes there. You are
ambitious: you shall rise; and, when you are forty, revisit these
scenes, a man of wealth and influence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Ah, Mr. Thornton, when one has a friend like you to
lead the way, success is certain. I am proud of your friendship, and
thankfully place my future in your keeping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> That shows keen wit at the outset. Trust me, and
you shall win. (<i>Rises.</i>) But I am keeping you from your friends, and
I know a pair of bright eyes are anxiously looking for you. (<i>Goes to

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Ah! my "sweet by and by" is close at hand. (<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Jessie</span>, <span class="smcap">r.</span>, <i>with pail</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> O you truant! (<i>Runs to him.</i>) Now, don't flatter
yourself that I came in search of you. Do you see this pail? this is
my excuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> 'Tis an empty one, Jessie. I am very sorry you have
been anxious on my account; but I'm all ready, so let's in to supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Not so fast, sir: the pail must be filled. I'm going
for milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Then "I'll go with you, my pretty maid."&mdash;You'll
excuse me a moment, Mr. Thornton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Mr. Thornton!&mdash;Dear me, I didn't see you! Good

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Good evening, Miss Jessie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Are you very, very hungry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Oh, ravenous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Then don't wait, but hurry in, or I won't be
responsible for your supper: huskers are such a hungry set.&mdash;Come,
Harry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Don't wait, Mr. Thornton: it takes a long time to get
the milk; don't it, Jessie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Not unless you tease me&mdash;but you always do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Of course, I couldn't help it; and tease and milk
go well together. (<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>,
<span class="smcap">l.</span> <span class="smcap">Thornton</span> <i>stands</i> <span class="smcap">c.</span><i>looking after

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Yes, yes, 'tis a cheery old place. Pity the storm
should ever beat upon it; pity that dark clouds should ever obscure
its brightness; yet they will come. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> first time in a life
of passion and change, this rural beauty has stirred my heart with
a longing it never felt before. I cannot analyze it. The sound of
her voice thrills me; the sight of her face fascinates me; the
touch of her hand maddens me; and, with it all, the shadow of some
long-forgotten presence mystifies me. This must be love. For I would
dare all, sacrifice all, to make her mine. She is betrothed to him.
He must be taken from her side, made unworthy of her, made to forget
her. The task is easy to one skilled in the arts of temptation. Once
free, her heart may be turned towards me. 'Tis a long chase: no wonder
I am melancholy, Harry Maynard; but there's a keen, patient hunter on
the track, who never fails, never. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">John Maynard</span>,
<span class="smcap">r.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Maynard.</span> Well, well, here's hospitality: here's
hospitality with a vengeance. That rascal Harry has deserted you, has
he?&mdash;you, our honored guest. It's too bad, too bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Don't give yourself any uneasiness about me, old
friend. Harry has left me a moment to escort a young lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Ah, yes, I understand: Jessie, our Jessie, the witch
that brings us all under her spells. No wonder the boy forgot his
manners; but to desert you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Don't speak of desertion; you forget I am one of
the family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> I wish you were with all my heart. I like you, Mr.
Thornton. I flatter myself I know a gentleman, when I meet him. You
came up here, looked over my stock, and bought my horses at my own
price, no beating down, no haggling; and I said to myself, He's a
gentleman, for gentlemen never haggle. So I say I like you (<i>gives his
hand</i>), and that's something to remember, for John Maynard don't take
kindly to strangers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> I trust I shall always merit your good opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Of course you will; you can't help it. There's
our Harry just raves about you, and you've taken a fancy to him. I
like you for that too. Then you are going to take him away, and show
him the way to fortune by your high pressure, bustle and rush, city
ways. Not just the notion I wanted to get into his head; but he's
ambitious, and I'll not stand in his way. He's our only boy now. There
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> another; he went down at the call of his country, a brave, noble
fellow, and fell among the first; and he died bravely: he couldn't
help it, for he was a Maynard. But 'twas a hard blow to us. It made
us lonely here; and even now, when the wind howls round the old house
in the cold winter nights, mother and I sit silent in the corner,
seeing our boy's bright face in the fire, till the tears roll down
her cheeks, and I&mdash;I set my teeth together, and clasp her hands,
and whisper, He died bravely, mother,&mdash;died for his country like a
hero,&mdash;like a hero.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Ah! 'tis consoling to remember that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Yes, yes. And now the other, our only boy, goes
forth to fight another battle, full of temptation and danger. Heaven
grant him a safe return!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Amen to that! But fear not for him. I have a
regard, yes, call it a fatherly regard; and it shall be my duty to
guard him among the temptations of the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> That's kind; that's honest. I knew you were a
gentleman, and I trust you freely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> You shall have a good account of him; and 'twill
not be lonely here, for you have a daughter left to comfort you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Our Jessie, bless her! she's a treasure. Sixteen
years ago, on one of the roughest nights, our Harry, then a mere boy,
coming up from the village, found a poor woman and her babe on the
road lying helpless in the snow. He brought her here: we recognized
her as the daughter of one of our neighbors, a girl who had left
home, and found work in the city. This was her return. Her unnatural
father shut the door in her face, and she wandered about until found
by Harry. She lingered through the night, speechless, and died at
sunrise. I sought the father, but he had cast her out of his heart and
home; for he believed her to be a wanton. Indignant at his cruelty, I
struck him down; for I'm mighty quick-tempered, and can't stand a mean
argument. I gave the mother Christian burial, took the child to my
heart, and love her as if she was my own. As for him, public opinion
drove him from our village; and her child is loved and honored as he
could never hope to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> And your son will marry her with this stain upon
her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Stain? what stain? Upon her mother's finger was
a plain gold ring; and, though the poor thing's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> lips were silent,
her eyes wandered to that ring with a meaning none could fail to
guess. She was a deserted wife; and, even had she been all her father
thought her, what human being has a right to be relentless, when we
should forgive as we all hope to be forgiven? But come, here I am
chatting away like an old maid at a quilting. Come in, and get your
supper, for you must be hungry: come in. (<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span> <i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">l.</span>, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, <i>with his arm round</i> <span class="smcap">Jessie</span>,
<i>the pail in his hand</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Yes, Jessie, 'tis hard to leave you behind; but our
parting will not be for long. Once fairly embarked in my new life,
with a fair chance of success before me, I shall return to seek my
ready helper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Harry, perhaps you will think me foolish, but I
tremble at your venture. Why seek new paths to fortune when here is
all that could make our lives happy and contented?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> But it's so slow, Jessie; and, with the best of luck,
I should be but a plodding farmer. To plough and dig, sow and reap,
year in and year out,&mdash;'tis a hard life, all bone and muscle: to be
sure, rugged health and deep sleep; but <i>there</i> is excitement and
bustle, quick success and rousing fortunes. Ah, Jessie, if one half my
schemes work well, you shall be a lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> To be your own true, loving wife, your ever ready
helper, is all I ask. O Harry, if you should forget me in all this
bustle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Forget you? Never: in all my hopes you are the shining
light; in all my air-built castles, which energy should make real and
substantial ones, you are enthroned my queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Enthrone me in your heart: let me be an influence
there, to shield you from temptation, and, come fortune or failure, I
shall be content.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> An influence, Jessie: hear my confession. Unknown to
you, I stood beneath your window last night, as you sat looking up at
the moon, singing the song I love, "In the sweet by and by." I thought
how soon we must part, and your sweet voice brought tears to my eyes.
Jessie, I believe, that, were I so weak as to fall beneath temptation,
in the darkest hour of misery, the remembrance of that voice would
call me back to you and a better life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> You will not forget me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh, we are getting melancholy. (<i>Smiles.</i>) Why should
<i>I</i> not fear a rival?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Now you are jesting, Harry. Do I not owe my life to
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Hush, hush! that is a forbidden subject, and all you
owe to me has been paid with interest in the gift of your true, loving
heart. (<i>They pass off</i>, <span class="smcap">r.</span> <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Capt. Bragg</span>,
<span class="smcap">c.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. Bragg.</span> Well, I never&mdash;no, never. If Parson Broadnose
himself, in full black, with all his theological prognostications to
back him, had said to me, Capt. Bragg, did you ever? I should have
fixed my penetrating eyes upon him, and answered boldly, No, never.
Slighted, absolutely, undeniably, unquestionably slighted! I, Capt.
Nathan Bragg, distinguished for my martial deportment, my profound
knowledge, my ready wit, yes, every thing that adds a charm to
merrymaking; I, ex-commander of that illustrious corps, the Lawless
Rangers, that rivals the grandest European regiments in drill and
parade,&mdash;slighted at a mean, contemptible little husking. Fact, by
jingo! But I'm not to be slighted: I won't be slighted. I am here
to testify my profound contempt for a slight. If John Maynard has
a husking, and forgets to invite the grand central figure on such
occasions, it is the duty of the grand central figure to overlook the
little breach of etiquette, and appear to contribute to the happiness
of its fellow townsmen. There is an air of gloom about this place,
all owing to my absence. They're in to supper: I'll join them, to
cheer the dull hearts and (<i>going</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>)&mdash; Hallo! guns, guns.
(<i>Takes up one.</i>) There's a beauty. This reminds me of my warlike
days at country muster, and the Lawless Rangers. Ah, those rangers!
every man with a Roman nose, six feet high, and a dead shot: not a man
would miss the dead eye at one hundred paces,&mdash;if he could help it.
Ah! I can see 'em now as I gave the order: ready&mdash;aim&mdash;fire (<i>raising
gun and firing as he speaks.</i>) Murder! the blasted thing was loaded.
(<i>Drops it, and staggers across stage to</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>, <i>trembling.

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Who fired that gun? Ah, Capt. Bragg, what's the
matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub</span> (<i>taking up fowl</i>). Dat ar poor ole rooster am a gone
goose. Dat's what's de matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> (<i>taking up gun</i>). Captain, have you been meddling with
my gun?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard.</span> Of course he has: he's always meddling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> Mrs. Maynard, that's an absurd remark. It's all right:
one of my surprises. You must know I wanted a rooster for to-morrow's
dinner. I'm very fond of them: there's such a warlike taste about
them. And we are a little short of roosters; my last one, being a
little belligerent this morning, walked into Higgins's yard, and
engaged in deadly combat: so deadly that Higgins's fowl was stretched
a lifeless corse upon the ground: for Bragg's roosters always lick,
always. But in spite of my earnest protest, despite the warlike maxim,
Spoils to the victor belong, Higgins shot my rooster and nailed him to
his barn door like a crow, and <i>his</i> crow was gone. Fact, by jingo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Yes: but what's that got to do with my rooster?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> Well, I wanted a rooster: so says I to myself,
Maynard's got plenty, he can spare one just as well as not; so I'm
come to borrow one. Well, I found you had company, and not wishing to
disturb you, and seeing a gun handy, I singled out my dinner roosting
aloft there, raised the gun,&mdash;you know I'm a dead shot,&mdash;shut my eyes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Shut your eyes! Is that one of your dead shot tactics?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> Shut one eye, squinted, of course, that's what I said,
and fired. The result of that shot is before you. If you will examine
that fowl, you will find that he is shot clean through the neck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> He's shot all ober; looks jes for all de world like a
huckleberry puddin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Well, captain, I call this rather a cool proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> Ah, you flatter me: but coolness is a characteristic
of the Braggs. When I raised that company for the war, the Lawless
Rangers, I said to those men, Be cool: don't let your ardor carry you
too far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yours didn't run you into battle, did it, captain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> I couldn't run anywhere. Just when the call came for
those men, after I had prepared them for battle, and longed to lead
them to the field, rheumatism&mdash;in the legs too&mdash;blasted all my hopes,
and left me behind. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> my soul was with them, and, if they achieved
distinction, they owed it all to my early teaching&mdash;to the Bragg they
left behind. (<i>Struts up stage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Maynard</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Thornton</span>). Ah! he's a sly old fox.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>tapping his head</i>). A little wrong here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> No, he's a cool, calculating man, but as vain as a
peacock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> (<i>coming down</i>). Sorry I didn't know you had company.
Wouldn't have intruded for the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> It's all right, captain. Join us: we were expecting
you. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Thornton</span>.) I can say that truly, for he's always
popping in where he's not wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> Ah! thank you. A-husking, I see. What's the yield?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Excellent. My five-acre lot has given me two hundred
bushels. That's what I call handsome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> Pooh! you should see my corn. There's nothing like
Bragg's corn. My three-acre lot gave me three hundred bushels, and
every other ear was a red one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> The same old errand: chasing that will-o'-wisp, Kitty
Corum,&mdash;she who is known as the girl with two strings to her bow; who
has one hand for Tom Larcom and another for Nat Harlow, and no heart
for either. I'm the laughing-stock of the whole neighborhood; but
misery loves company, and Nat is in the same box. If she would only
say No, and have done with it, I believe I should be happy, especially
if Nat received the "No." She won't let either of us go. But she must.
To-night I'll speak for the last time; I'll pop. If she takes me,
well: if not, I'll pop off and leave the field to Nat. Luckily I found
out she was to help Mrs. Maynard to-day. Nat hasn't heard of it, and
no doubt he's trudging off to old Corum's. Here she comes. Lay there,
you beauties! (<i>Puts flowers on bench.</i>) Kitty will know what that
means. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span> <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>from house</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> What a nice woman Mrs. Charity Goodall is, to be
sure! so graceful and sweet, not a bit like her big rough brother,
John Maynard. But then, she's learned the city ways. A widow, poor
thing&mdash;and not so poor, either; for her husband, when he died, left
her a consolation in the shape of a very handsome fortune. (<i>Sees
flowers.</i>) I declare, somebody's attentions are really overpowering.
No matter where I am, either at home or abroad, when night comes I
always find a bunch of flowers placed in my way. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> course these
are for me: no one would think of offering flowers to Jessie. Poor
Jessie! 'tis eighteen months since Harry Maynard left home, and six
months since a line has been received from him. Ah, well! this comes
of having but one string to your bow. I manage matters differently.
(<i>Sits on bench. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Nat</span> <i>from</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>, <i>through
gate; steps behind tree</i>.) Now, I really would like to know who is so
attentive, so loving, as to send me these pretty flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>sticks his head round tree</i>, <span class="smcap">r.</span>). And can't
you guess, Kitty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> (<i>starting</i>). O Nat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>sticks his head out from</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span> <i>Aside.</i>) O Nat!
indeed, you owe Nat nothing for flowers. The mean sneak! (<i>Retires.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>coming forward</i>). Now, this is what I call luck, Kitty.
I heard you were here, and I think I've taken the wind out of Tom
Larcom's sails to-night. No doubt he's tramping off to your house to
find nobody at home. Ha, ha! had him there. (<span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>creeps out,
and gets behind tree</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> And so I am indebted to you for all these pretty
flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Oh! never mind the posies, Kitty. I have something very
serious to say to you to-night. (<i>Sits beside her</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Very, very serious, Nat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> As serious, Kitty, as though I were a prisoner at the
bar waiting my sentence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ah! in that case, there should be a full bench, Kitty.
(<i>Comes round and sits on bench</i>, <span class="smcap">l.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> The deuce! Tom Larcom, what brought you here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I came to court; that is, to see justice done you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> You be hanged!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Thank you: let that be your fate; and I'll be
transported. (<i>Puts his arm round</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty's</span> <i>neck</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> How dare you, Tom Larcom? (<i>Pushes off his arm.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> It's "neck or nothing" with me to-night, Kitty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Tom, you are taking unfair advantage of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Am I? How about Kitty's posies, Nat, that I laid upon
the bench?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> It's you, then, Tom.&mdash;O Nat! how could you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> I didn't: I only asked you a conundrum. All's fair in
love. What's a few flowers, any way? Why, Kitty, smile upon me, and
you shall have a garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes, a kitchen garden, with you as the central
figure,&mdash;a cabbage-head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Kitty, you must listen to me. I have a serious question
to ask you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> So have I, Kitty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> You too, Tom? A pair of serious questions! Shall I get
out my handkerchief?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Kitty, I have sought you for the last time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Thank Heaven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> O, Kitty, give him your blessing, and let him depart!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> I am on the point of leaving&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Good-by, old fellow. You have our fondest wishes
where'er you go. "'Tis absence makes the heart grow fonder"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span>&mdash;Of leaving my fate in your hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Oh, this is touching!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> 'Tis now two years since I commenced paying attention to
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Stop, Nat. This is a serious business: let us be
exact,&mdash;one year and ten months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Correct. I remember it from the circumstance that I had,
about a month before, singled you out as the object of my adoration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> "We met by chance."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> "The usual way." Oh come, Nat, do be original!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> I worshipped the very ground you trod on&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> And I the shoes you trod in: that's one step higher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> From that time&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> One year and ten months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> From that time I have loved you sincerely, devotedly,
and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> <i>Etcettery.</i> Same here, Kitty, with a dictionary thrown
in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> You have become very, very dear to me, Kitty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You are enshrined in this bosom, Kitty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Without you, my life would be miserable&mdash;a desert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> And mine without you, Kitty, a Saharah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> I have waited long to gain your serious attention, to
ask you to be my wife. Now is the appointed time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>takes out watch</i>). Fifteen minutes after seven: the
very time I appointed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Let me hear my sentence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Put me out of misery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> This is indeed serious. Am I to understand that you
have both reached that point in courtship when a final answer is
required?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> That's exactly the point I have reached.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> It's "going, going, gone" with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> You will both consider my answer final?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Both.</span> We will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> No quarrelling, no teasing, no appeal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> None. (<i>Aside.</i>) I'm sure of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Never. (<i>Aside.</i>) Nat's sacked, certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Very well. Your attentions, Mr. Harlow, have been very
flattering,&mdash;your presents handsome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Well, I'm not a bad-looking&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> I mean the presents you have bestowed upon
me,&mdash;calicoes of the latest patterns, sweetmeats in great varieties,
which you, as a shopkeeper, have presented me with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>aside</i>). At old Gleason's expense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Of course I value them. But a girl wants the man she
loves to be a hero: to plunge into rivers to rescue drowning men, and
all that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>aside</i>). And Nat can't swim. That's hard on him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> And you, Mr. Larcom, have been equally attentive. Your
gifts&mdash;the choicest fruits of your orchard, the beautiful flowers
nightly laid within my reach&mdash;all have a touching significance. Still,
as I said, a girl looks for something higher in the man she loves. He
must be bold&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>aside</i>). Tom's afraid of his own shadow. He's mittened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Rush into burning houses, stop runaway horses, rescue
distressed females; and I am very much afraid neither of my devoted
admirers can claim the title of hero. So, gentlemen, with many thanks
for your attentions, I say No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> No! That is for Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> No! You mean Nat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> I mean both. (<span class="smcap">Nat</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>look at

Ah! here he is. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Stub</span>, <span class="smcap">l.</span>, <i>through gate,

brought no letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> Jes none at all, Miss Jessie; dat ar' post-officer am

jes keep his eye onto me all de time. No use, no use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

Mr. Thornton is coming up the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span> (<i>springing up</i>). Mr. Thornton? Heaven be
praised! News of Harry at last! (<i>Runs up to gate, meets</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.
Thornton</span>, <i>takes his hand; they come down</i>.) O Mr. Thornton!
Harry, what of Harry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Miss Jessie, I am the bearer of bad tidings. Would
it were otherwise!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Is he dead? Speak: let me know the worst; I can bear
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Be quiet, my child. He is not dead; better if he
were, for death covers all the evils of a life,&mdash;death wipes out all
disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Disgrace? Oh, speak, Mr. Thornton! why is he silent?
what misfortune has befallen him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> The worst, Jessie. Perhaps I should hide his
wretched story from you; but I'm here to tell it to his friends,
and you are the dearest, the one who trusted him as none other can.
Jessie, the man you loved has been false to you, to all. He has abused
the trust I placed in him. He has become a spendthrift, a libertine, a
gambler, and a drunkard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> I will not believe it: 'tis false. Harry Maynard is
too noble. Mr. Thornton, you have been misled, or you are not his
friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> I was his friend till he betrayed and robbed me. I
am his friend no longer. Jessie, you must forget him; he will never
return to his old home, his first love. He has broken away from my
influence: he associates with the vilest of the vile, and glories in
his shame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Stop, stop! I cannot bear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Jessie, you know not how it pains me to tell you
this; but 'tis better you know the worst. I have striven hard to make
his path smooth,&mdash;to make his way to fortune easy, for your sake,
Jessie. For I,&mdash;yes, Jessie, even in this dark hour I must say it,&mdash;I
love you, as he never could love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> You&mdash;love&mdash;me? You! Oh! this is blasphemy at such a
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> I could not help it, Jessie. (<i>Tries to take her
hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Do not touch me. I shall hate you. Leave me. O Harry,
Harry! are you lost to me forever? (<i>Staggers up and sits on bench.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>aside</i>). I've broken the ice there. Rather rough;
but she'll get over it. Now for old Maynard. I'd sooner face a
regiment; but it must be done. (<i>Exit into house.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> (<i>comes down to</i> <span class="smcap">Jessie</span>). O Jessie, this is
terrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Don't speak to me, Kitty: leave me to myself. I know
you mean well, but the sound of your voice is terrible to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> (<i>comes down</i>). Poor thing! Who would have believed
that Harry Maynard could turn out bad? I wish I could do something to
help her. I can, and I will too. Oh, here's Tom! (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Tom!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>turns</i>). Eh! did you speak, Miss Corum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Yes, I did. Come here&mdash;quick&mdash;why don't you pay
attention?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Didn't you forbid any further attention?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Pshaw! no more of that! Do you remember what I told
you my husband must be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes: a sort of salamander to rush into burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> houses,
an amphibious animal to save people from drowning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Ahem! Tom, to save people: just so. Well, Tom, you can
be that hero, if you choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Me? How, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Harry Maynard has got into trouble in the city; he's a
drunkard and a gambler, and every thing that is bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You don't mean it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> It's true. Now, he must be saved, brought back here,
or Jessie will die. Tom, go and find him, and when you come back, I'll
sacrifice myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Sacrifice yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Yes, marry you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You will consider him found. O Kitty, Kitty,&mdash;but hold

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> No, Tom: I'm serious now. Find Harry Maynard, and you
shall be my hero.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Hooray, Kitty: tell me all about it. I'll be off by the
next train. Come (<i>gives her his arm</i>), I can't keep still: I must
keep moving. (<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Lost! lost to me, and I loving him so dearly! You
must forget him! He said forget: it is impossible. He loved me so
dearly, too, before he left this house in search of fortune. No, no:
I will not give him up; there must be some way to save him. If I only
knew how! O Harry, Harry! why do you wander from the hearts that
love you? Come back, come back! (<i>Covers her face and weeps. Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Charity Goodall</span> <i>from</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>, <i>through gate</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Oh, this is delicious! I've climbed fences, torn
my way through bushes, and had the most delightful frolic with
Farmer Chips's little Chips on the hay, with nobody to check my fun
and remind me of the proprieties of life. Ha, ha, ha! How my rich
neighbor, Mrs. Goldfinch, would stare to see me enjoying myself in the
country! Little I care! I shall go back with a new lease of life, a
harvest of fresh country air, that will last me through the winter.
(<i>Sees</i> <span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.) Hey-day, child, what's the matter? (<i>Sits
beside her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span> (<i>flinging her arms round</i> <span class="smcap">Charity's</span> <i>neck</i>).
O Aunt Charity! Harry, Harry&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Ah! the truant's heard from at last; and not the
most delightful tidings, judging by your tear-stained cheeks. Well,
child, tell me all about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> He's lost to us. He has fallen into temptation; he's&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> The old story. "A certain man went down unto
Jericho, and fell among thieves."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> O Aunt Charity, how can you be so heartless!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Heartless, Jessie! You must not say that. You know
not my story. Listen to me. One I loved dearer than life was ingulfed
in this whirlpool. He was a brave, noble fellow, who took a poor
country girl from her home, and made her the mistress of a mansion,
rich in comfort and luxury. For years our life was one of happiness;
and then a friend, a false friend, Jessie, led him into temptation,
with the base hope of securing his riches by his ruin. The friend
failed to acquire the one, but wrought the other. He died ere he
had become the wretched sot he hoped to make him; died in my arms,
loving and repentant. I had his fortune, but my life was blighted. I
refused to be comforted until the wretchedness about me brought me to
my senses. Then I sought in work, strong, earnest work, consolation
for my bereavement. With his wealth, I sought out the wretched, the
outcasts of society; gave my aid to all good work, and so earned the
title of a strong-minded woman. 'Tis often spoken with a sneer, that
title, Jessie; but they who bear it have the world's good in their
heart, thank Heaven for them all! And so I go about doing all I can to
relieve distress, the surest solace for sorrow, Jessie; for there's
nothing so cheering, as relieving the wretchedness of others. So don't
call me heartless, Jessie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> O Aunt Charity, he was so good! he loved me so dearly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> And he has fallen. Who told you this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> His friend Mr. Thornton: he is here now, speaking
with father. O dear aunt! can nothing be done to save him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Thornton? What Thornton? Speak, Jessie, who is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Here comes Mr. Thornton. I will not see him. He has
spoken to me of love,&mdash;his love for me, almost in the same breath in
which he told of Harry's ruin. Oh, let me go! I can not, will not meet
him. (<i>Runs off</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> So, so: the friend of Harry makes love to his wife
that is to be, and his name is Thornton. I am curious to see this
<i>friend</i>. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Thornton</span> <i>from house</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> That job's over. Now for Miss Jessie.

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Yes, Charity Goodall, widow of Mark Goodall, your

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> So, sir, you are the friend of my nephew, Harry
Maynard? here on a mission of mercy, to break gently to his sorrowing
friends the news of his downfall?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> 'Tis true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> And to console his affianced wife with the proffer
of your affection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> 'Tis false!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> It is the truth. I know you, Robert Thornton. Your
work made my life a burden. You robbed me of one I loved; and now you
have wound your coils about another victim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> You are mistaken: I sought to keep him from
temptation; but he was reckless, and forsook me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Where is he now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> I know not; neither do I care. He robbed me; and,
were he found, I should give him up to justice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Staunch friend indeed! He robbed you? I do not
believe it. I have cause to mistrust you. I never dreamed you were the
friend of Harry. But now I can see your wicked scheme. You have him in
your power, but beware! My mission is to save. (<i>Goes up</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>coming to</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>). Too late, too late. I do
not fear you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard</span> (<i>outside</i>, <span class="smcap">r.</span>). Say no more: I will not
seek him. (<i>Enter from house, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard.</span> O John, don't say that! He is our only boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> He has disgraced the name of Maynard. I will not
seek, I will never allow him to cross my threshold. He went out a
man: he shall never return a brute. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Capt. Bragg</span>,
<span class="smcap">r.</span>, <i>through gate</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> Now, done yer say that, Maynard (hic). It's
disgrace-ful to drink. I mean to get full. I never got full. I can
drink a gallon, an' walk straight, I can (hic). But I'm a Bragg. I'm
Cap'en Bragg of the Horse Marines; no, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> ill-ill-lus'rus Lawless
Rangers, every man&mdash;full&mdash;full&mdash;six&mdash; Now look a' here, look a' me,
if your son's gone to the dogs, don't you give him up. Look a' me.
I'm Bragg. I had a son: you know him: went off twenty years ago. Do I
give him up? Not a bit of it (hic). He'll come back one of these days,
rolling in his carriage; I mean in wealth. But then, he's a Bragg. We
can't all be Braggs. Come, le's go down, and hunt him up. I know all
the places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Not a step will I stir. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jessie</span>,
<span class="smcap">l.</span>) He has made his bed: let him sleep in it. He shall not
disgrace my house with his presence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span> (<i>runs to him, falls on her knees</i>). No, no, father:
don't say that. You will not cast him off. Think what a kind son he
was: how he loved us all. You will try to save him, father! Don't say
you will not; my heart will break.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> Jessie, you know not how low he has fallen. My son
of whom I was so proud! He has disgraced his home. Henceforth he is no
longer son of mine. I will not seek him. I have said it, Jessie, and
John Maynard never breaks his word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span> (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Thornton</span>). O Mr. Thornton!
you will seek him: you will save him for my sake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> He is past redemption. 'Twere useless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Then I will go in search of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynard.</span> You, Jessie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Yes, I. He saved me, when a babe, from the pitiless
storm; now I will seek him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> This is folly. He lurks with the vile and
worthless, in dens of filth and vice. Who will lead you there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity</span> (<i>comes down</i> <span class="smcap">c.</span>). I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span> (<i>rises and runs into her arms</i>). O Aunt Charity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Yes, I. When man shrinks from the work of salvation,
let woman take his place. Look up, child! Foul treachery has insnared
him. From the toils of the false friend, from the crafty arts of the
boldest of schemers, we will snatch him: from the depths of despair,
we will save him. Past redemption, Robert Thornton? False! While there
is life, there is hope!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murdock.</span> Thornton, you have a princely way of doing things,
and the luck of the evil one himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Shrewdness, old fellow. I'm an old hand at this
sort of business, and glitter and dash go a long way in sharpening the
appetites of one's customers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murdock.</span> There's something more than glitter about this wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> The wine is good, and costly too. Of course, I do
not set this before everybody, or the profits would hardly come up to
my expectation. I never throw pearls before swine. Home-made wares pay
the best profit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murdock.</span> Ah! you do a little in the way of doctoring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> A great deal, Murdock. I have a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> good
dispensary close at hand, and Maynard has made himself decidedly
useful in that branch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murdock.</span> Maynard? is that miserable sot of any use to you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Oh, yes! I alone can control him. Poor devil! he's
breaking up fast. It's a pity such a likely young fellow could not let
rum alone; but he would drink, and will until the end comes. 'Twill
not be long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murdock.</span> Where do you keep him? I've not seen him about
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Close by, but out of sight. Some of his friends, a
few months ago, made a demonstration towards his rescue from the pit
into which he had fallen. I believe they are now searching high and
low for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murdock.</span> An idle task, while he is in your clutches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> You're right, Murdock: he stood between me and the
dearest wish of my life. Meddling fools thwarted me in that; and now,
from sheer revenge, I'll hold him from them all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murdock.</span> I'd rather have you for a friend than an enemy.
(<i>Rising.</i>) Good-night. I must look after my own humble quarters. Ah!

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>turns with a start</i>). You here?</p>

so dark and dismal up there! and the rats&mdash;oh, such rats!&mdash;glare at me
from their holes. I couldn't stay. Don't send me back: I'll be very
quiet. I'm sober too. Not a drop for two days: not a drop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> What's the matter with you now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Oh! nothing, nothing: only I wanted to be sociable
(<i>tries to smile</i>),&mdash;as sociable as you and I were in the old times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Sociable! you and I! Bah! you're shaking like an
aspen. What friendship can there be between me and a miserable sot
like you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Yes, I know I'm not the man I used to be: I know it.
Oh, the thought of that other life I lived once, tortures me almost to
madness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Well, why don't you go back to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Back? back to that old home among the hills from which
I came, full of lusty manhood? Back to the old man who looked upon
me with all a father's pride? the dear mother whose darling I was?
the fair, young girl whose heart I broke? Back there, with tottering
steps, a pitiful wreck, to die upon the threshold of the dear old
home? No, no: not that, not that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Then be quiet. You have brought ruin upon yourself:
you can't complain of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> No, I don't complain. It was a fair picture of fame
and fortune you laid before me; and when I found the <i>honorable</i>
mercantile business, in which you had amassed wealth, was work like
this, I should have turned back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> I told you to keep a clear head and a steady hand;
to <i>sell</i>, not poison yourself with my liquid wares.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Yet you placed pleasures before me that turned my
head, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> They never turned mine. You were a fool, and fell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Ay, a fool! Yes, your fool, Robert Thornton. I quaffed
the ruby wine, I flung myself into every indulgence, because you led
me. I must keep a cool head and a steady hand, with fire in my veins!
I feel I am condemned. Of my own free will, I flung away a life. I
do not complain; but, when we stand before the last tribunal, Heaven
be the judge if your hands are unstained with my life-blood, Robert
Thornton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Enough of this: back to your den.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> No, no, Thornton, not there! I will be quiet, silent;
but do not, in mercy, do not drive me back there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Poor devil! Well, stay here: look after the bar
until Daley returns. (<i>Aside, going</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>) He can't resist:
he'll make a dive for the brandy, and forget. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> days without it: I

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Stay here! No, no, he has given me a chance for
freedom. The doors are open: a dash, and I am free. Free for what?
To die in the gutter. I could drag myself no farther; and who would
look with compassion on such a ragged, bloated wretch as I? No, no:
I have sold myself, body and soul, to this accursed life. (<i>Staggers

freedom,&mdash;freedom from this maddening thirst, these horrible fears
that drive me mad. (<i>Staggers behind bar.</i>) Ah, here, here! (<i>Seizes

should die of madness. (<i>Buries his face in his arms upon the bar.

Harry, young fellow, how are you? (<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>falls back, and
glares at him</i>.) Don't know me, hey? Why, I'm Bragg, Capt. Bragg,
your distinguished townsman; Bragg of the Rangers; every man a
sharpshooter, and their commander&mdash;well, modesty forbids my mentioning
him in fitting panegyrics. Why, how you stare! You don't look well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> I don't know you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> Won't do, my boy, won't do. You may be able to bluff
common folks, but I'm Bragg; Bragg of the judicial brow, Bragg of the
penetrating eye: it's a keen one, and, when I fixed that detective's
orb upon you, I said, There's my man! Why, they've fitted out an
exploring party for the purpose of hunting you up,&mdash;Mrs. Charity
Goodall, Jessie, Tom Larcom, and that black imp Stub. They've scoured
the city in vain. They didn't ask my help, and I am the keen-eyed
volunteer that never misses his mark. I have found you. Oh, here's
glory, for Bragg's outwitted 'em all! I knew I should: Bragg never
fails, never; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> now I've got you, you can't escape me. Come, come,
don't glare like a madman. What will I have? Brandy, of course!
(<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>sets decanter and glass before him</i>.) They made a
mistake: when there's any detective business to be done, call a Bragg.
He can see farther and run faster than the sharpest of 'em. Fact, by
jingo. (<i>Pours liquor into glass.</i>) Ah, that's my style! (<i>Raises
glass.</i>) Here's to the glorious Rangers, Bragg's own!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). Stop! don't drink that. See, there's a
snake twisting and turning about in the glass. Stop, or you are a dead
man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> (<i>sets down glass, and staggers back</i>). Jersey
lightning!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> (<i>glaring</i>). See, it's raising its head,&mdash;it will
strike deep and sure: and there's another, and another. Look, they are
crawling about the decanter: now they drop upon the bar: they are upon
you: tear them off, tear them off! They strike and kill, strike and
kill!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> He's raving mad. I wish I was well out of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Thicker and thicker, faster and faster, they come upon
the bar. See them glare at me! Back, back! (<i>Dashes his hands upon
bar.</i>) Ah, they coil about my arms. Away, away! (<i>Attempts to tear
them off.</i>) They crawl about me: they are at my throat. Help, help,
help! (<i>Runs into</i> <span class="smcap">c.</span>, <i>and falls upon floor</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> He's got 'em bad. (<i>Runs to entrance,</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>)
Fight 'em, young man, fight 'em: it's your only chance. I guess I
won't drink: can't stop. (<i>Runs up and off</i>, <span class="smcap">r.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> (<i>raises his head</i>). Gone, gone at last with him. I've
driven them off again; but they will come again. What's that? (<i>Glares
into corner</i>, <span class="smcap">l.</span>) Rats again: fierce and big! how they look
at me! Away! Gleaming teeth and eyes of fire! Away, I say! I cannot
drive them back. They swarm about me: they're at my legs. (<i>Tears them
off.</i>) Devils, I'll fight you all! Closer and closer! (<i>Gets to his
feet.</i>) They're making for my throat: away, I say! (<i>Tears them from
his breast.</i>) I cannot, cannot. Now they're at my throat! (<i>Hands at

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Not there, not there, Thornton. Don't thrust me into

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>turning to table, and laying down pistol</i>). Away:

<p><span class="smcap">Charity</span> (<i>throws off cloak</i>). Don't be too sure of that,

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>turns quickly</i>). Charity Goodall! (<span class="smcap">Stub</span>
<i>comes down softly, takes pistol, goes up, crosses stage, and hides
behind bar</i>.) I beg your pardon, Mrs. Goodall. This is indeed a
surprise!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> And yet you have been expecting me; dreading the
hour when you and I should meet face to face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> This is hardly the place for a woman who would
guard her good name from scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> You forget I am a woman above suspicion: that I have
won a good name, by daring to enter such dens as yours, on errands of
mercy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Ah! indeed! what errand of mercy brings the saintly
Charity Goodall into my humble saloon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Ah, you confess ownership! The spider of the gilded
web! You, who, under the guise of a gentleman, lured my husband from
an honorable life: you, who, with flattering promises of honorable
wealth, tricked a brave lad to his ruin. Your humble saloon! You
sneer, and yet you tremble. Confess all: confess you are a villain and
a cheat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> I will not listen to you. Be warned in time: at any
moment, a rude throng may burst upon you. You are liable to insult
from which I could not protect you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Fear not for me: my mission is my protection. Alone,
I have walked into the worst dens, without fear, without insult. With
the most abandoned, no hand is raised against one who comes to rescue
and deliver. Robert Thornton, listen to me: day and night I have
sought, with ready helpers, Harry Maynard. To-night I have tracked him
here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Ay, here! You threw me from the scent with your
story of his utter degradation. I never dreamed the silly fly was
ensnared in the gilded web. Give him back to the friends who mourn for
him, and, spite my wrongs, all shall be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> You ask too much: you see he is not here. You have
been misinformed: for once the shrewd angel of mercy has been deceived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Indeed! Perhaps another may be more
successful&mdash;Jessie! (<i>Enter from</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>, <i>hurriedly</i>,
<span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Have you found him? Speak! in mercy, speak!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity</span> (<i>putting her arm about</i> <span class="smcap">Jessie</span>). Be calm,
my child: there is the man who holds him in his power,&mdash;Robert
Thornton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Mr. Thornton? No, no, it cannot be! (<i>Falls on her
knees to him.</i>) If you know where he is, if you can give him back to
his father, to me, I will bless you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> You are mistaken, Jessie; I cannot give him back.
You know how much I loved him. Think you, if it were in my power, I
would refuse the request of the only woman I truly loved?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Oh, this is mockery! (<i>Rises, and goes to</i>
<span class="smcap">Charity</span>, <i>who folds her in her arms</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Poor child, your prayers are vain: that man is
pitiless!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> I told you you had been deceived. Was I not right?
You tracked him here, and yet you cannot find him. See how your
well-laid plan has failed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> No; for I have one resource left, one taught me by
the noble women of the West. You fear for my good name: do you fear
for those who come to my aid with the song he loved? Pray heaven it

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard.</span> The snow comes faster and faster. It's time
Stub was back from the depot with Charity. Ah, 'twill be a dull
Thanksgiving for us this year: not like the old times when we had
Charley, Harry, and Jessie, to make us all merry. Dear me! time does
break up households. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>from door</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I've put him on Harry's bed, mother. I expect you'll
scold when you see your white counterpane muddied by his boots, for
I couldn't get him beneath it. Poor devil! I fear 'twill be his
deathbed. I'd about made up my mind that I'd never give another tramp
shelter; but he looked so bad, I hadn't the heart to turn him away
(<i>sits on bench</i>) when I thought, mother, that our poor boy might have
come in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard</span> (<i>comes down</i>). That's so like you, John! Is he
very bad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Yes: broken down with hunger and drink. He begged hard
for a little brandy. It was well I had none, for 'twould have been
cruel to refuse him, and I would die ere I touched the curse, the
cause of so much misery to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard.</span> Ah, John, all that's over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Yes, mother, we must hope for the best. He was saved,
thanks to Charity: but still I fear for him. 'Twill be a day to
remember, when we have him back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard.</span> A long, long year since Charity found him, and
no word or sign from our loved one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ah, mother, I like that: I was uncharitable,&mdash;I, who
have been so bitter against others who turned their faces from the
fallen. But I'm proud of <i>him</i>. "Tell father," he said to Charity,
"tell him I will never cross his threshold till I can return as I
went,&mdash;a man." That's so like a Maynard! that's the true grit: I like
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard.</span> And Charity will give us no news of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> No: she shakes her head. "Give him time, give him
time:" but she smiles when she says it; and, when Charity smiles, you
can depend upon it all's going well. We must trust her, mother. So we
have two more faces in the fire, Harry's and Jessie's. (<i>Sleigh-bells
heard without.</i>) Ah! there she is, there she is! (<i>Goes to window.</i>)
No, it's Tom and Kitty with the baby. Why, mother, they've brought the
baby: here's a surprise for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>outside</i>). Whoa, I tell you! Give me the baby, Kitty:
that's all right. Now come along, come along. (<i>Enters door in flat,

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Tom, glad to see you: this is hearty. Come to the fire;
and, Kitty, give us a smack. (<i>Kisses</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Hallo! easy there; but I suppose it's all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Right? of course 'tis. Now give me the baby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> To serve in the same style? No, I thank you; it's a
tenderer bit than Kitty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Tom, don't be silly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard.</span> I'll take him, Tom, the little darling. (<i>Takes
baby.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>reluctantly giving it up</i>). Certainly, only handle him

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard</span> (<i>sits on settle.</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>helps</i>
<span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>off with her things</i>). Oh, you little beauty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>leans on mantle, back, and watches her</i>). The picture
of his daddy: that's what they all say. Is his nose all right? Ain't
much of it, but, if the frost got at it, good-by nose. Take care! Oh,
Lord, I thought you had dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> him. Hey, Johnny, look up: he's a
smart one for a three-months' older. Hadn't I better take him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Tom, do you suppose Mrs. Maynard don't know how to
handle a baby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, I don't know, Kitty; they break awful easy.
You just keep your eye on him until I put up the horse. (<i>Going;
returns.</i>) Does he look all right, Mrs. Maynard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard.</span> Right! don't you see he's wide awake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes: but hadn't he ought to be asleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Tom, do go and put up your horse. I never saw such a
goose; when he's awake, you think he should be asleep, and when he's
asleep you want to wake him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Parental anxiety. You see, Mrs. Maynard, this is
something new to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Well, isn't it new to all of us? Do go along!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I'm off. (<i>Exit door in flat.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Such a plague!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ah, Kitty, not satisfied! You regret not having taken
the other, Nat Harlow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> No, indeed. Tom's the best husband in the world.
I've not heard a cross word from him the whole year since we've been
married; but he does make such a fuss about baby! Sha'n't I take him,
Mrs. Maynard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh, ho! somebody else makes a fuss too. (<i>Sleigh-bells

John, I've often envied you your quiet evenings here, with this for
company; often seen you and Hannah sitting here together, taking so
much comfort. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard</span>, <span class="smcap">r. u. e.</span>, <i>and
leans on bench, between</i> <span class="smcap">Charity</span> <i>and the fire</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard.</span> O Charity! tell us of our boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Yes, yes, Charity, be merciful: what of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity</span> (<i>rises and comes</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>). Oh, do be patient!
I've a strange fancy to see how you look there in the old seat. Come,
take your places, and tell me what you see there. (<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>sits
with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard</span> <i>on bench, she next the fire; he takes her
hand</i>.) That's nice. (<i>Goes to back of bench.</i>) Now, tell me, what see
you there? (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Stub</span>, <i>door in flat, excitedly</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> I've put 'em up, Miss Charity, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Silence, Stub! (<i>He comes down</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub</span> (<i>aside</i>). Dat's de quarest woman eber I see: ben in de
house five minutes, an' not tole de news.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Well, John, I'm waiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> There, Charity, is my picture-gallery of old memories,
that both sadden and cheer waiting and aching hearts. What do I see?
(<i>Looking into fire.</i>) The face of my brave soldier boy: the face that
has glowed upon us in its noble manhood for many, many years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> The face of a hero, John: there are no bitter
memories there. He died bravely: passed into the better life with the
grand army of martyrs, crowned with glory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> Yas indeed, dead an' gone, Massa Cap'n: God bless him!
Miss Charity, am you gwine to tell&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Be silent! (<span class="smcap">Stub</span> <i>goes</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>,
<i>shaking his head</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> I shall bust it out: I can't help it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Well, brother John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Another, a younger face. Now I see it with the glow of
health upon the cheeks, the eye bright and laughing, as I have seen it
come and go before me in the old days. And now&mdash;'tis pale and haggard:
the eyes are bloodshot. O Charity, the face that has haunted my sleep!
I have tried to shut it out; but it comes before me with a look full
of reproach. Oh had I but been merciful, all this might not have been!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> And yet that, too, is the face of a hero.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> Oh! why don't she tell 'em?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Go on, John: look once more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Once more: the face of a fair, bright girl, who won
her way to my heart. I never knew how much I loved, until I lost her.
She left me, nobly left me: I had no right to stay her. Will she come
back, Charity? will she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> Why, don't you know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Silence, Stub! Now, brother John, let me tell you
what I see there. I see the face of that same brave, true girl, in
all its beauty: the girl who forsook home and friends, with the brave
wish in her heart to save her lover from destruction. I see her gladly
embracing a life of hard, grinding poverty, cheering the fainting
spirit of a broken man, guarding and guiding him through the dark
valley of remorse, until he stands alone, strong, resolute, determined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Jessie, our Jessie: well, well, go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> I see her with the rich glow of health again
mantling her cheeks: I hear the ringing laugh of the happy girl again:
I see her returning to her father's house (<i>enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jessie</span>,
<i>door in flat</i>), a proud, true, happy wife!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span> (<i>running down to</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>). Here, here again:
dear, dear father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>rising, and taking her in his arms</i>). Jessie, my
darling, a thousand and a thousand times welcome!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Dear, dear mother, your child has returned to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard</span> (<i>takes her in her arms</i>). O Jessie, Jessie,
welcome! do you come alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Be patient! sit you down and listen. (<i>They sit
again</i>, <span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>kneeling between</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard</span> <i>and
the fire</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> Wh-wh-what all dis mean? Ain't you gwine&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span> Silence, Stub! I see another face,&mdash;the face of the
young man who went forth to fight the battle of temptation. I see him
struggling: I see friends around him: I see one with a true, loving
heart, clinging to him through good and evil report: see him fighting
valiantly in the distant West: see the freshness of renewed life in
his ruddy cheek, until, his foe beneath his feet, he comes back to his
old home. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, <i>door in flat</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>rushing down</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>). I see it all, Charity: my
boy has come home. Where, oh, where is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Here, father, here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>turns</i>). O Harry, Harry! my dear, dear boy! (<i>Rushing
into his arms.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stub.</span> Hi, golly! dat's de ticket, dat's de ticket!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Mother, have you no word for the truant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard</span> (<i>embracing him</i>). My heart is too full, Harry!
(<span class="smcap">Harry</span>, <span class="smcap">c.</span>; <span class="smcap">Mrs. Maynard</span>, <span class="smcap">r. c.</span>;
<span class="smcap">Jessie</span>, <span class="smcap">r.</span>; <span class="smcap">Mr. Maynard</span>, <span class="smcap">l. c.</span>;
<span class="smcap">Charity</span>, <span class="smcap">l.</span>; <span class="smcap">Stub</span>, <i>extreme</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Mother, father, of the bitter past&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> We'll not hear a word, Harry. We have you safe again:
let the sorrows of the past be forgotten in the joy of the present.
Mother, look at him! what a frame, what a face! Hang me, if I don't
believe all this has been a joke!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Nay, father, in remembering the trials we have passed,
we gain new hope for the future. I am a free man, with a home of my
own; rich Western lands own me as master; but I owe all to the dear
girl who loved me,&mdash;the brave, noble woman who befriended me. Come
here, little wife: let my parents see that the child they adopted is
now theirs by right. (<span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>goes to him</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> Yes, father, we ran away and were married: will you
forgive us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Forgive you, puss? it was Harry's salvation! (<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <i>door in flat</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> There, the horse is all right: now for the baby. Bless
my soul, where's the baby? (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <span class="smcap">r. u. e.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Asleep, Tom; don't make such a noise!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Asleep! he'll die of starvation. Here! (<i>Takes
nursing-bottle from his pocket.</i>) I forgot to leave his luncheon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> (<i>snatching bottle</i>). Tom, I'm ashamed of you, before
all these folks! (<i>They go up. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Capt. Bragg</span>, <i>door in
flat</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> Ah, Maynard, how are you? I just dropped in as I was
going by. Why, bless my soul! Harry Maynard, as fresh as a buttercup!
Why, how are you? and Jessie too! Well, this is glorious! (<i>Shakes
hands.</i>) John, old friend, you're a lucky dog! I thought the boy was
about gone, the last time I saw him; but he's come round all right.
Ah! I always told you to keep up a stout heart! Look at me: I'm nearly
seventy: my boy has been gone twenty years; but I know he'll come
back,&mdash;come back a hero, or a millionnaire: he couldn't help it! he's
a Bragg. He'll come back!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>outside</i>, <span class="smcap">l.</span>). Away! away, you cannot
reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> me: I defy you, I defy you! (<i>Rushes in</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>, <i>and
falls prostrate at</i> <span class="smcap">Bragg's</span> <i>feet</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> (<i>shrinking back</i>). Hallo, what's this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> (<i>runs to</i> <span class="smcap">Thornton</span>, <i>and raises his head</i>).
Merciful Heavens, 'tis Thornton!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Thornton!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>feebly</i>). Who said Thornton? What, Maynard!
Maynard, you here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> O Thornton! has it come to this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Yes, Maynard, I'm down: down deeper than I had
you. There's no hope! Only a year, only a year! I was cheated. I, who
thought myself so shrewd and keen, in one night lost all, and took to
drink. Oh, it's glorious to drown all trouble in the flowing bowl!
Ha, ha! but it gets you at last: it has me. I have begged, cheated,
stolen, for a single draught. Give me a drink: a drop of brandy, only
a drop to cool my burning throat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> You ask this of me, whom you so bitterly wronged?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Yes, I did wrong you; but I loved that girl as
I loved but one other! Maynard, Maynard, hear me! this one woman I
wronged: she haunts me: she was my wife. I forsook her, cast her off.
She came from your native town. Her name&mdash;her name was&mdash;Alice Clarke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Alice Clarke&mdash;Jessie's mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Jessie's mother! No, no; don't tell me that: don't
make me a greater villain than I know myself to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> She died beneath my roof, giving her child to my
keeping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> He is my father: stand back! Harry, my place is here!
(<i>Kneels, and supports him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton</span> (<i>looks in her face</i>). And I pursued you with a
sinful love: brought <i>him</i> down to the very gates of death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessie.</span> All is forgotten, all forgiven, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Take her away, take her away: I can't bear her
touch! (<i>Crawls down stage.</i>) Her eyes glare at me! There's the look
of her dead mother in them. Oh, spare me, spare me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> O Thornton, Thornton, this is terrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> Thornton! you're wrong. Call me by my rightful
name: you must have heard it,&mdash;William Bragg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> William Bragg?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> No, no; it cannot be! You, you my Bill? Curse you: you
stole that name! That was my boy's,&mdash;a handsome, noble fellow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> I am your son!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> It's a lie: you're a miserable wretch! Think you a
Bragg would come home in such a plight? I'll not believe it. (<i>Looks
at him, then sinks on his knees, covers his face.</i>) It's false! I can
not, will not believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thornton.</span> You must, you do, old man. You might have made me a
better man; but you nursed my vanity, and&mdash;well, well, it's all over
now. I've dug my grave: let me rest in peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt.</span> (<i>rising to his feet</i>). No, no peace for you: you have
disgraced my name. Die, die like a dog! Why did you come back here to
ruin me, to drag me down from my position, to make me a by-word and a
scorn among my neighbors? Why didn't you die in the gutters of your
infamous city? But here, here! Die, but take my&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity</span> (<i>puts her hand on his shoulder</i>). Pause ere you
speak. He is dying; he has sinned: leave his punishment to a higher
Power. Here, where our hearts are warm with gratitude for a blessed
deliverance, curse not, but forgive as we all hope to be forgiven!</p>
